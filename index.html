    <p>Welcome to The Recipes for Rock Bottom: The Culinary Catastrophe Collection — where the recipes are barely edible, the humor is fully cooked, and your expectations should be left at the door.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re a broke student, a midnight snacker with no shame, or someone who thinks “gourmet” means “put cheese on it,” you’re in the right place.</p>
    <p>From Sad Bachelor Spaghetti to Existential Crisis Sandwiches, this is where you learn to cook meals that scream: “I tried my best... kinda.”</p>
    <p>Bon appétit, brave soul. You're about to enter a kitchen where chaos reigns and ketchup counts as a vegetable.</p>
