    <h3>How chefs describe it ?</h3>
    <p> A culinary masterpiece born out of desperation and minimal grocery runs. Al dente noodles meet a chaotic drizzle of ketchup and dramatically torn slices of American cheeseâ€”because who needs real sauce or dignity? Best enjoyed on the floor of your studio apartment while questioning your life choices. <strong>Optional: garnish with existential dread.</strong></p>
    <h4>The ingredients you'll need</h4>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 pack of dry spaghetti (or whatever's on sale)</li>
        <li>Ketchup (yes, it's the sauce now)</li>
        <li>1 sad-looking slice of American cheese</li>
        <li>A single tear (optional, for seasoning)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h4>The steps you should follow</h4>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Boil water like you're trying to steam away your poor life decisions.</li>
        <li>Drop spaghetti in. Stir once. Contemplate your life.</li>
        <li>After 8 minutes, strain pasta using a plate because your colander is MIA.</li>
        <li>Squeeze ketchup directly onto pasta like a true culinary rebel.</li>
        <li>Tear cheese into dramatic, uneven shreds. Sprinkle like confetti at your pity party.</li>
        <li>Mix with a fork you probably haven't washed since last Tuesday.</li>
        <li>Serve in a bowl you once used as an ashtray. Cry. Eat. Repeat.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h4>Pro Tip: Add hot dogs for a fancier version (aka "Broke Bolognese").</h4>
    <h4>Enjoy your depressing meal !</h4>
